# hci-language

A pattern language for computer systems that promote human wellbeing

# Why

- Our sense of wellbeing is a function of our experiences.
- Our experiences are defined by perceptions of our environment.
- Computer systems are increasingly interwoven with our lives - they constitute a large part of our environment.
- We have long recognized that the physical spaces we inhabit impact our wellbeing for good or ill (c.f. Christopher Alexander's works). When physical space is not structured according to human needs, its inhabitants suffer.
- [Research suggests](https://ledger.humanetech.com/) that computer systems can likewise take a heavy toll on our wellbeing.
- As virtual spaces come to define more of our experiences, we will need new pattern languages that can shape those spaces for the benefit of their inhabitants.

# What

- This repository houses patterns for shaping software systems, interfaces, and communities.
- Our scope includes code, software architecture, user interfaces, team dynamics, and open-source communities.

# Who

- We consider the needs of various groups affected by computer systems' existence and operation:
- Users, nonusers, product owners, programmers, designers, sysadmins, and distributors.
- Of these groups, only programmers truly have the power to put the patterns into effect. Programmers ultimately determine what gets built.
- The effective use of the pattern language is therefore the responsibility of programmers.

# Collaborating

Please keep in mind:

- This repo is public.
- We're all human. Be kind.
- This org has room for many different repos (Christopher Alexander's [Mosaic of Subcultures](https://patterns-dev.github.io/patterns/newpat/newpat8/newpat8.htm) pattern).
- But we lean toward accepting contributions rather than telling people to start their own project. No one should have to work alone.
