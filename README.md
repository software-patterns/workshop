A [pattern language](https://groupworksdeck.org/pattern-language) for making humanizing computer systems.

Here, "humanizing" refers to the effect that computers should ideally have on people and their relationships with each other.
It does *not* imply "making computers more human-like".

# Why

**Our surroundings have profound effects on our wellbeing.**

Architect Christopher Alexander cites many examples in his book [_A Pattern Language_](http://library.uniteddiversity.coop/Ecological_Building/A_Pattern_Language.pdf).
  - Tall apartment buildings prevent their inhabitants from casually going out or seeing what is going on in the street, leading to significant increases in mental illness. (_A Pattern Language_ p. 115).
  - Rooms with natural light only on one side make it harder to perceive subtle facial expressions due to glare from the window. (p. 748)
  - Local roads that function as shortcuts attract through-traffic and become unpleasant and unsafe. (p. 261)
  
**When spaces are discordant with the physical, social, and psychological needs of their inhabitants, they feel
artificial, mechanical, deathlike.**

Vast parking lots, impersonal apartment blocks, litter-strewn streets with traffic zooming past:
people avoid such spaces, if they can. They don't maintain or care for them.
And their peace of mind is eroded a little each time they are forced into contact with these spaces.

**To say that these spaces are deathlike is no mere metaphor. They are literally self-destroying.**

The spaces and the people each take from the other more than they give. Neither one gives sustenance to the other,
and so gradually the whole system destroys itself. Such systems can only be kept going at great expense or
through legal coercion.

**But it does not have to be this way.**

Though inhuman, ugly buildings and cities are now the norm, each of us can (I hope) recall places that
are different: places that are beautiful, where we feel at ease, free to be ourselves,
connected to the people around us. Places where we look around and smile, where we are serene, where
we become voluble and magnanimous and stoic and wistful.

These places are *alive*. They are constantly changing, yet they seem eternal, as if they could happily
go on existing forever without losing their essential selves.

Alexander claims that places like this share a startlingly simple property: they were made, not by
the execution of some master plan,
but by many small acts of creation by the people who live and work there.

**The places we cherish are not the output of a design-upfront, build-it-once, demolish-after-twenty-years process,
but the result of a constant flow of tiny acts of repair and renewal.**

One might at first assume that the result of so many small, independent acts would be chaos—a cacophony
of conflicting design concepts that work at cross purposes and ultimately negate each other.
But that doesn't happen. Instead of chaos, we get order. Exactly *why* we get order is the question
Alexander seeks to answer.

**For order to arise organically like this, the individual builders must be drawing their ideas from some common source.**

Though there is no overarching design, the various pieces all have something in common that allows them
to harmonize with each other and with the whole system. That means that the people who made those
pieces must have shared something as well. But what is that mysterious *something*?

**Alexander calls the design elements that are shared by a community *patterns*.**

Patterns are not plans or cookie-cutter components. They are more abstract than that. They
describe the relationships between elements (which may themselves be patterns) that solve
a particular problem.

**For example, the architectural pattern *Window Place* tells you where to place furniture in a room.**

When people enter a room they likely want to sit down, but they also tend to seek natural light.
If there is nowhere for them to sit near a window, the tension between these two forces makes people
avoid that room, and it becomes a dead space. But if you create a definite *place* for people to be
comfortable near a window, they will use it and take care of it. Then the room may live.

**Yet a single isolated pattern, however good, is not enough to give a place life.**

In order to be effective, a pattern must be sustained by many other smaller patterns working in
concert.

You know intuitively that a small window high up on a wall can never create an effective *Window Place*.
A window that looks onto a blank wall or a parking lot is no better. A window that is a single large pane of glass
makes people near it feel uncomfortable, so it also will make a bad *Window Place*.

The patterns *Low Sill*, *Windows Overlooking Life*, and *Small Panes* address each of these concerns.
When all of the patterns in a space are working together, we feel at ease. The interactions
between the patterns are so intricate and subtle that we may not even be able to identify what
we like about the place—we only know that we like it.

The most special and subtle of these places have the character of poems: the patterns in them are densely packed,
overlapping, startlingly new and yet familiar.

**These relationships among patterns have the structure of a language.**

If patterns are like words, a *pattern language* is like the grammar that tells us how to put the words together
into useful, meaningful sentences. Patterns are defined in terms of other patterns, and
perhaps in terms of archetypes and examples. Humans seem to have the same uncanny knack for
pattern languages that they do for spoken languages: a fluent "speaker" can use the pattern
language even if they can't formally describe the grammar.

This, then, is the answer to the mystery of how architecture can unfold organically from a thousand
independent acts: the builders all share a pattern language.

The fact that patterns are abstract allows endless variety; the fact that they precisely target
specific problems ensures their effectiveness; the fact that they form a language creates
the fractal self-consistency that characterizes the places that we love.

At its roots the pattern language is connected to ordinary language, and serves the same purposes:
cultural transmission and differentiation. Yet it is different from ordinary language in one
important way: *it does not just describe the world, it acts upon it*.

**A pattern language is the means by which a shared world-concept can be made manifest.**

Alexander's works are often cited as being concerned with architecture, but I think that's underselling them.
They describe nothing less than a comprehensive vision for human civilization. They are an instruction
manual for creating a more beautiful, more humane world.

**But the advent of personal computers has changed the set of activities and interactions that pattern languages must account for.**

Alexander did his work on patterns in the 1970s. At the time, Unix was just being born. Personal computers
didn't yet exist. Alexander's language says nothing
about how we might begin to integrate computers into the patterns of space and activity that
shape our lives.

**We must account for the effects of computers if our language is to be whole.**

Anecdotally, the language people use when talking about software hints that they conceive of it as an
extension of physical space. People speak of being "on a webpage" or going "to a site"—though of course
it would be more accurate to say the site's data comes to them. The cursor and the viewport are extensions
of the ego: "scroll down" still means "look further down the page", despite Apple's efforts to foist
inverted scrolling conventions on us all.

Yet even if we did not think of computer systems as a new type of space, we would have to
account for them in our pattern languages, because computers have physical and societal effects that
extend beyond the screen and which
[we have yet to grapple with](https://ledger.humanetech.com/).
Our failure to integrate computers into our society in sustainable ways has already caused disastrous damage.

- In 1996, a software engineering mistake [caused the Ariane 5 rocket to self-destruct](https://www.dreamsongs.com/MobSoftware.html),
resulting in the loss of [$370 million](https://blog.bugsnag.com/bug-day-ariane-5-disaster/) worth of hardware.
- [In 2013, the Healthcare.gov website launched](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HealthCare.gov), on time but tenfold over budget—and didn't work for the vast majority
  of people who tried to access it. By August 2014, the total cost of project had exceeded $1.7 billion; the initial estimate was $93 million.
- [In 2015, the number of distracted-driving accidents surpassed the number of drunk-driving accidents and caused
a third as many deaths](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-news/4671/drunk-driving-vs-distracted-driving-dangerous/).
- In 2016, [disinformation campaigns on social media](https://www.thedailybeast.com/facebook-now-says-russian-disinfo-reached-150-million-americans) may have swung the U.S. presidential election.

Data breaches, security vulnerabilities, deliberate manipulation of users by software vendors, and misuse
of private information are so commonplace that I don't even need to give examples of them here.
No matter when you're reading this, you'll no doubt be able to recall a few examples from the last month or so.

[We cannot look for single "root causes" of failure to address these issues](https://web.mit.edu/2.75/resources/random/How%20Complex%20Systems%20Fail.pdf). The problems are systemic,
and the solutions must be holistic.

**What we need now is an extended pattern language that accounts for computer systems.**

Such a pattern language will constitute an instruction manual for creating a society where:

- *Computer systems support and sustain the non-computational patterns of society.*
- *Personal computers enhance physical space and activity.*
- *The economic gains of improved communication and computation are equitably distributed.*
- *People have the means to shape and adapt their own software, just as they adapt their own physical space.*
- *Self-consistency and local symmetries arise at every level, even as infinite variety unfolds, by
  the simple fact that the pattern language is shared.*

The result of all of this will be a society with the character of nature: exuberant, diverse, no
two places alike—yet unified, whole, and self-sustaining.

# What

- This repository is a space for giving and receiving feedback on patterns.
- It will never be "finished" or publishable; rather, it is a community resource from which
  the raw materials of publishable works can be mined.
- It is a space where we can let our weirdest and wildest ideas run loose.
  - *but please illustrate your weird ideas with lots of examples; it's hard to talk about ideas without something concrete to point to. —benchristel*
- Our scope includes code, software architecture, user interfaces, team dynamics, and open-source communities.
- Our quest is to seek [the quality without a name](https://onluminousgrounds.wordpress.com/2010/04/24/the-quality-without-a-name-part-one/).

# Who

*I'd like to consider the needs of various groups impacted by computer systems.
Users, nonusers, product owners, programmers, designers, sysadmins.
Whatever we end up writing, we have to make sure programmers are on board with it,
because they ultimately determine what gets built (and they'll likely be a large
part of our audience). But having multiple viewpoints
is vital. One possible goal of this work is to convince programmers that they can 
live harmoniously in the world; that holding themselves to high ethical standards
is not stupid. —benchristel*

# Collaborating

This repository is structured in a way that I hope will encourage
collaborative, piecemeal growth.
- You can add a pattern to the [patterns directory](./patterns)
  by following [these instructions](./patterns/00_PATTERN_TEMPLATE.md).
- You can add links to the [References](./references.md) file.
- If you have feedback on a specific pattern, you can start a discussion, [wiki-style](http://wiki.c2.com/?PatternLanguage),
  in an italicized block within the pattern text itself. Below is an example of this.

*I prefer patterns to be concrete, specific, and grounded in our experiences.
Any positive experience you've had creating or using software is
a potential seed for a pattern. If you've also experienced
the pain of* not *having the pattern in your environment, so much the
better—that's evidence that the pattern actually does something. But you
don't need a lot of evidence to write the pattern. Patterns
can (should?) start out as just hypotheses; over time I'd like to test each
pattern more rigorously and see if it really holds up. —benchristel*
