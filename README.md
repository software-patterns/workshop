# hci-language

A [pattern language](https://groupworksdeck.org/pattern-language) for computer systems that promote human wellbeing.

# Why

- Our sense of wellbeing is a function of our experiences.
- Our experiences are defined by perceptions of our environment.
- Computer systems are increasingly interwoven with our lives - they constitute a large part of our environment.
- We have long recognized that [our physical surroundings have profound effects on our wellbeing](http://library.uniteddiversity.coop/Ecological_Building/A_Pattern_Language.pdf). People suffer when the spaces they
  inhabit stir up conflicting stresses within them that they cannot resolve.
- In _A Pattern Language_, Christopher Alexander unfolds the concept of a **pattern**: a recurring set of relationships
  among architectural elements that allows people to resolve their conflicting stresses.
- [Recent research suggests](https://ledger.humanetech.com/) that computer systems, just like physical spaces,
  take a heavy toll on our wellbeing.
  Computers have introduced new stresses into our environments—stresses that cannot be resolved by
  the patterns in _A Pattern Language_.
- What we need now is an extended pattern language that accounts for this. 

# What

- This repository is a space for collaborating on patterns.
- Our scope includes code, software architecture, user interfaces, team dynamics, and open-source communities.

# Who

*I'd like to consider the needs of various groups impacted by computer systems.
Users, nonusers, product owners, programmers, designers, sysadmins.
Whatever we end up writing, we have to make sure programmers are on board with it,
because they ultimately determine what gets built (and they'll likely be a large
part of our audience). But having multiple viewpoints
is vital. One possible goal of this work is to convince programmers that they can 
live harmoniously in the world; that holding themselves to high ethical standards
is not stupid. —benchristel*

# Collaborating

This repository is structured in a way that I hope will encourage
collaborative, piecemeal growth. You can add to the [patterns directory](./patterns)
by following the instructions in the [Pattern Template](./patterns/00_PATTERN_TEMPLATE.md).
You can also add links to the [References](./references.md) file. If you have
feedback on a specific pattern, you can start a discussion, [wiki-style](http://wiki.c2.com/?PatternLanguage),
in an italicized block within the pattern text itself.
Below is an example of this.

*I prefer patterns to be concrete, specific, and grounded in our experiences.
Any positive experience you've had creating or using software is
a potential seed for a pattern. If you've also experienced
the pain of* not *having the pattern in your environment, so much the
better—that's evidence that the pattern actually does something. But you
don't need a lot of evidence to write the pattern. Patterns
can (should?) start out as just hypotheses; over time I'd like to test each
pattern more rigorously and see if it really holds up. —benchristel*

The following resources help explain what patterns are all about:

- [Martin Fowler's "Writing Software Patterns"](https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/writingPatterns.html)
- [_A Pattern Language_, by Christopher Alexander et al.](https://mythstyles.com/products/a-pattern-language-towns-buildings-construction-center-for-environmental). The original pattern language; this one is about physical architecture,
not software. The book is also available [as a PDF](http://library.uniteddiversity.coop/Ecological_Building/A_Pattern_Language.pdf).
