create an environment where people can thrive. *Energized Work* describes
the atmosphere of a workplace where these larger patterns intersect.

**The joy of work is often killed off at large companies, poisoned by a
thousand stresses: tight deadlines, managers breathing down necks, their
reports jockeying for status even as they struggle under the burden of years
of bad technical decisions. Everyone is tired. Everywhere there is fear.**

Or the opposite extreme: work is mind-numbingly boring; no one understands
the value of what they do; when things fall apart no one seems to care.
People spend half their day aimlessly browsing the internet. Everyone's
work seems to be blocked; they are waiting for something to happen elsewhere.

**Bring people into daily contact with the immediate, qualitative impacts
of their work. Ensure that everyone's work *has* some immediate impact.
The stakes should not be so high that they create stress and fear—people
should not feel that their livelihood is in jeopardy—but neither should
they feel like they're playing poker for matchsticks.**

*"Dogfooding" (though I hate the term for its implication that what I
produce is just barely fit for human consumption) is an effective way of making the
impact of work tangible. I am most enthusiastic about work when thing
I am working on is something I use or want to use.*

*If using your own product isn't possible, keep people in touch with real feedback from users
or customers. Keep the metrics qualitative, not quantitative. I, for one, tend
to obsess over quantitative metrics, and overreact to meaningless fluctuations.

If you don't have control over the above, the biggest thing you
can do to impact your energy at work may be to get enough sleep. Seek practices
that enable you to sleep well. Do not deprive other people of sleep.

*I swear my IQ swings by 50 points depending on whether I slept
well the past few nights. No other factor makes as great a
difference in my ability to learn, think, and communicate. —benchristel*
