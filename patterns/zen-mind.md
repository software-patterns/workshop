**Programming is a mentally-demanding task. And when programmers make mistakes, their computers compound them.**

Programming is a mentally-demanding task. During a typical work week, a programmer
not only has to keep straight hundreds of facts about the system they work on, but
understand the relationships between them as well. If a presumed fact is later found not
to be true, or not to be true in all circumstances, many other assumptions usually
need to be checked, as they may have relied implicitly on the falsified fact.
The more complex the system being programmed, the harder it is for people to do this
type of mental bookkeeping reliably. 

Most of the patterns in this language focus on *eliminating needless complexity*
rather than improving people's cognitive abilities. The simple reason for this is
that computer systems are often orders of magnitude more complex than what a person
can keep in their conscious awareness. It is just not possible to fit large
computer systems in our heads all at once.

This pattern examines the question: given that we work on systems that do *not*
fit in our heads, what is the best frame of mind to be in
when programming? What does "appropriate discipline" look like?
